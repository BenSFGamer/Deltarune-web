# Deltarune-web
Deltarune for web browser

In brief, I'm planning on making a web browser version of Deltarune where it can be played via by browser. 

Two files in which I will need assistnace in uploading here is "data.win" and "mus" folder (from the game's files). I've had no luck in running git LFS for large files. So delegate that to collaberators.

Email me (bendumas3@gmail.com) if you would like for me to send you the files so you may upload them on your end.
