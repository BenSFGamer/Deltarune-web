# Deltarune-web
Deltarune for web browser

In brief, I'm planning on making a web browser version of Deltarune where it can be played via by browser. 

Two files in which I will need assistnace in uploading here is "data.win" and "mus" folder (from the game's files). I've had no luck in running git LFS for large files. So delegate that to collaberators. 

Email me (bendumas3@gmail.com) if you would like for me to send you the files so you may upload them on your end.

Everything is a uploaded. Next step is to compile some of the file to WebAssembly (.wasmb) and Emscripten (Emcc) and so that the software would run in broswer as it would on an OS.

2/20/2026 Update: Chapters 3-5 is next.
